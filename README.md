# Transit-Overcharges-Calculator
Commuter discovers that the Transit system was overcharging him

- I noticed that from 2016 to 2017, the transit charged me extra fare during transfer windows. 
- Rather than checking my card balance every day or reading through a data file manually, I wrote a script to find anomalies that could indicate invalid overcharges
- The code is run for a single year of data at a time and the user inputs what their daily commuting costs should be. The program then returns all days where there were potential overcharges 
- With the transit agency that I used, there were 2 hour transfers along the same route. Where I thought there were invalid overcharges, I confirmed that I was transferring on the same route and when I brought this up with customer service, I was refunded for the overcharges. 
- Please feel free to adapt this code for your own purposes or reach out to me if you have any questions/suggestions :)
